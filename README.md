Game Plumbing Framework (GPF) is a server-authoritative C# game framework. It provides a backend infrastructure and reactive UI, addressing key challenges in C# game development. GPF includes ServerObject (server authority), DataStore (global render-able data), and ViewBindings (reusable UI components connected to the DataStore).
